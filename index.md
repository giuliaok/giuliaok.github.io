## Giulia Occhini

Hey there! I am a third year PhD student in Computational Social Sciences and NLP at the University of Bristol and The Alan Turing Institute. I am currently in a research intern in AI and cities at MILA Québec (Jan 2022 - May 2022). Before starting my PhD, I did my MRes in Computational Linguistics at Leiden University (Cum Laude).

**My research interests keywords:** Natural Language Processing, Complexity Economics, Urban Sciences, Data Science.

**Main supervisors:** Dr. [Emmanouil Tranos](https://etranos.info/) ([UoB](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Emmanouil-Tranos-b26cd054-b65e-438c-9a73-43d0ef833f8d/)/[ATI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/emmanouil-tranos)), Dr. [Levi John Wolf](https://www.ljwolf.org/) ([UoB](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Levi-Wolf-6fd84b18-4172-4b27-aac9-55092de68fdc/)/[ATI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/levi-john-wolf))

My research interest lies in the multidisciplianry work to understand our economic and urban dynamics as a society. I am also interested in methodological issues and unusual data sources for Computational Social Science (mostly Natural Language Processing and web-archival data). The aim of my PhD is to gain an understanding of the demographic and spatial features of emerging economic activities in the UK.

## Undergoing projects

### UNatural Language Processing: the best way to advance the methodological toolkit of urban analytics?

Previous studies in the field of GIS introduced the usage of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
both to extract geographically relevant information from text (e.g. geographic information retrieval) and
to complement imagery obtained from remote sensing through geolocated social media textual content. As much as the usage of textual processing techniques
has been advocated within the critical human geography tradition as well - mostly in order to confront
representation issues in a comprehensive and sophisticated way  - large scale NLP models
are still struggling to emerge in the field. 
A domain to which NLP can be fruitfully applied to, is online textual data. The study at hand is
going to provide an empirical illustration of how the usage of unstructured data sources scraped from
the web can reveal previously hidden insights on persisting urban inequalities in the digital space. More
specifically, this work uncovers formerly unknown patterns of occupational segregation happening within
the digital economy realm. In the study, NLP techniques are complemented with multilevel models,
allowing to provide an overarching description of occupational segregation phenomena accounting for the
role of place, gender and ethnicity following intersectionality theory. All in all, the projects' aim is to
showcase how digital econometrics can benefit from textual analysis at scale.
