Hey there! I am a third year PhD student in Natural Language Processing at the University of Bristol and The Alan Turing Institute. I am currently in a research intern in AI and citties at MILA Québec (Jan 2022 - May 2022). Before starting my PhD, I did my MRes in Computational Linguistics at Leiden University (Cum Laude).

**My research interests keywords:** Natural Language Processing, Complexity Economics, Urban Sciences, Data Science.

**Main supervisors:** Dr. [Emmanouil Tranos](https://etranos.info/) ([UoB](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Emmanouil-Tranos-b26cd054-b65e-438c-9a73-43d0ef833f8d/)/[ATI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/emmanouil-tranos)), Dr. [Levi John Wolf](https://www.ljwolf.org/) ([UoB](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Levi-Wolf-6fd84b18-4172-4b27-aac9-55092de68fdc/)/[ATI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/levi-john-wolf))

My research interest lies in the multidisciplianry work to understand our economic and urban dynamics as a society. I am also interested in methodological issues and unusual data sources for Computational Social Science (mostly Natural Language Processing and web-archival data). The aim of my PhD is to gain an understanding of the demographic and spatial features of emerging economic activities in the UK.

You can find my different programming projects in [my github website](https://github.com/giuliaok).

## Work experience 

- **Incoming Speech and Data Science Intern [Nuance Communications](https://www.nuance.com/index.html):** I currently work as part-time Machine Learning Engineer on Representation Learning. My work also focuses on the use of generative models such as Variational AutoEncoders to capture meaningful structure in the data. 

- **Research Intern at the [Québec Institute for Learning Algorthms (MILA)](https://mila.quebec/en/) (Canada):** Interned during summer 2021 at Inflammatix (San Francisco, USA) as ML Engineer. My work focused on data harmonisation and the development of a framework for the company.

- **Data Science Consultant [Jean Golding Institute for data-intensive Research](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/):**

- **Machiine Learning Tutor at [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/?hsLang=en):** Tutored and various Machine Learning courses at Cambridge Spark including: "NLP with Deep Learning" from LSTMs to BERT. 

- **Research Intern at the [Royal Dutch Institute for Indonesian and Caribbean studies](https://www.kitlv.nl/) (The Netherlands):** OxML Summer School organised by Saïd Business School (Oxford University), AI for Global Goals, Deep Medicine (Oxford University) and CIFAR. 17th - 25th of August

- **Student Research Assistant**

## Undergoing projects

### Understanding, Predicting and Preventing Drug-related Problems in England: A Data-centric Approach.

Author. The illicit drug market in the UK has evolved in the past decade, giving birth to new models of drug supply like deep-web online sales and the county lines model. Combined with a declining workforce from the different polices in the UK, getting a clear snapshot of the supply routes is becoming increasingly difficult. Using open data from the government for England, the aim of this project is to understand how these new supply models evolve over time. By doing this, we aim to understand the geographic structure of the demand of illicit-drugs and project the future routes with high risk of being overtaken by illicit drug suppliers. 

You can find the code for the project in [here](https://github.com/LeonardoCastro/BritishDrugDynamics)! 

A virtual poster will be presented at the [University of Bristol Data Week 2022](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/get-involved/data-week/).
